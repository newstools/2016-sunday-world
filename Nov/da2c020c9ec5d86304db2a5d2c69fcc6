 With jays on his feet, trendy blue jeans and a brown animated muscle shirt, the self-confessed family man is affectionate about the arts."Welcome to my crib gents. Can I get you something to drink?" he greets us as we arrive at his modest home in Broadacres, northern Joburg.A painter, Seate's Picasso influences come alive in the living room, where a black and white painting of his heroes Steve Biko, Oliver Tambo and Nelson Mandela stands parallel to a colour portrait of the muso's grandfather."These are the wise men I look up to," he declares.Let the eye wander a little, and there stands a mini library. Seate's favourite books lie on a black antique table boxed in by stylish black sofas."Out of all these books, the one I idolise is Bra Hugh's [Masekela] book and I have recently completed it," he says, of the recently updated Still Grazing: The Musical Journey.Seate says he is on a journey to reinvent himself, an illustrious career spanning more than 20 years notwithstanding."I feel like I have a long way to go. It's still a journey," he laughs, also letting it slip that he has been obsessed with deejaying of late.The 42-year-old father of four daughters, says the turn tables have given him a fresh take on music."Deejaying is an extension of what I have been doing over the years... it is a new and exciting mode of expression for me. I enjoy the performances and technology."Without going into detail, Seate hints that Bongo Maffin could make a return."We owe it to the people man, I think it is just a matter of putting our schedules aside and heed the call."
