 For a jazz novice, who started her singing career as a teenage vocalist in kwaito group Jack Knife in the mid-1990s, to get so much respect on the night of her album launch speaks volumes about her musical journey.Mazwai''s third and latest album Belede, her entry into the world of jazz, was launched on Thursday night at the Soweto Theatre.Having greats Sibongile Khumalo, Caiphus Semenya and Letta Mbulu in the audience was a mega stamp of approval for the nine-track album. And Mazwai did not disappoint. She walked onto the stage and had the audience eating out of her hand.After all, this was her night of transformation from a talented, young kwaito songstress to a measured jazz vocalist. And she did not fail.Piano sensation Nduduzo Makhathini and extraordinary bassist Herbie Tsoaeli, men of immense talent , were able to improvise when Mazwai was swept away by her inner spirits .She was especially emotional when she did Wakrazulwa, a piece she is dedicating to the late Busi Mhlongo.Mazwai still regards Mhlongo as her mentor while the larger public sees her as the heir to the throne left vacant by the Yapheli'Mali Yami hitmaker.When she did her own cover of West Wind accompanied only by piano, it was confirmation that Mazwai had now transcended the public's understanding of her talent.To move from one end of the musical universe to the other requires an extraordinary gift. Mazwai has it in abundance.Mazwai also did her own hit song Ndiyahamba in a manner that she has not performed it before.As an artist who grew up in a politically active family, she closed off with Makubenjalo. She raised her fist and the audience rose to their feet.
