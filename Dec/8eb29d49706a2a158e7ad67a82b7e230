 Among those who found themselves on the wrong side of the law were Kaizer Motaung Jnr, Orlando Pirates goalie Brighton Mhlongo, disgraced ANC Northern Cape provincial chairman John Block, ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman, Health Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi and Polokwane City boss Johnny Mogaladi.Motaung Jnr was arrested for allegedly assaulting his then wife Katherine Heider in a domestic violence squabble at their home in Sandton early this year. Heider withdrew the case against him when he later appeared in the Randburg Magistrate's Court.Mhlongo was nabbed by the Joburg metro cops for speeding during the Easter holidays along the Golden Highway at over 180km/h in a 120km/h zone.He was released on R1000 bail when he appeared in the Brixton Magistrate's Court.Block was sentenced to 15 years in jail for corruption after he and his co-accused Christo Scholtz were found guilty of corruption, fraud and money laundering by the Northern Cape High Court in Kimberley early this month.The pair have appealed their sentencing.Police in Kimberley have reopened a case of sexual harassment against Fransman after a series of WhatsApp messages he sent to 20-year-old Louisa Wynand before she was due to travel with him to attend the ruling party's 104th anniversary celebrations in Rustenburg, were forwarded by the Daily Maverick to the NPA, who in turn sent them to the Northern Cape deputy director of public prosecutions. Earlier, police announced that the charges had been withdrawn "due to lack of evidence".Motsoaledi and Mogaladi are accused by Limpopo herbalist Jonas Moloto of stealing intellectual property.Moloto opened a case at the Mahwelereng police station last week. He claims the pair stole his cancer vaccine development idea and used it to enrich themselves.The case has since been transferred to the Hawks for investigation.
