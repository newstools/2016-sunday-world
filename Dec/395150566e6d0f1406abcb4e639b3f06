 Jali, 26, who plays for Belgian side KV Oostende, allegedly asked Andile Nkosi to book a flight to Europe.The player, according to Nkosi, promised to repay her when she arrived in November."He told me a day before my flight tickets expired that he was coming to South Africa and that I would go back to Belgium with him since I could not secure a visa in time," said Nkosi.She said they instead did the nooky at a Pretoria hotel ahead of Bafana Bafana's match against Senegal last month."The national team was booked on the third floor at Southern Sun in Menlyn and he asked me to book a room on the second floor. He went out clubbing with his friends at Kong in Rosebank and came back at around 4am."When he came back, he wanted to have sex with me without a condom, but I refused. I forced him to go to a garage and buy some."When he came back, we had wild sex and he overslept and was almost left by the team bus that was taking them to Polokwane," she said.Jali confirmed knowing Nkosi, but said he had no comment on the story.Nkosi said their differences started when Jali returned to his club and left her behind.She said when she called him and demanded her money, he gave her the runaround."At some point he told me that Bidvest Wits player Thabang Monare will give me the money," she said.But Monare said: "The fact that I spoke to her on WhatsApp and SMSes doesn't mean that I know her. "Nkosi said of Jali: "He deposited R10000 on Thursday after you guys [Sunday World] phoned him."
