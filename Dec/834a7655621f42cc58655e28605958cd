"The church will come after me if I don't pay royalties for all songs, albums sold on iTunes"Sunday World can exclusively reveal the owner, who cannot be named for legal reasons, allegedly uploaded the church's multi-million rand music catalogue on iTunes and is selling it without the church's permission.In a desperate attempt to stop the owner from his alleged illicit trade, which is likely to pit Twala against Africa's biggest church, the versatile producer opened a case of fraud against the man at the Diepkloof Police Station on November 24.The case was later transferred to the Johannesburg Central Commercial Crime Unit for investigation.He said he was alerted of the alleged fraud by the church's representative Lebogang Ngxolobe who noticed the music after visiting the digital platform."I then asked this man who gave him the permission to send the catalogue to iTunes. He clutched at straws and said this music didn't sell but said he will pay what is due to us. But for me this is not only about the money, he is taking other people's intellectual property and selling it as if it's his."I'm a publisher of this music. I pay royalties to the church from all the profit I generate from the music. The church will come after me if I don't pay royalties for all the songs and albums that have already been sold on iTunes," he said.Twala added that he contacted a local company that oversees iTunes sales on behalf of South African artists to collate the sales records of the holy music."At the time, they estimated the sales to be at R600000. I'm so angry, these white people continue to treat us as if we are nothing. I want the law to take its course," he said.Attempts to solicit comments from the suspect and Z.C.C drew a blank.Police spokesman Kay Makhubela confirmed Twala opened a case of fraud and said investigations are under way.
