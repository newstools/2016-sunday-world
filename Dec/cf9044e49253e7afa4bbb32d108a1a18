 The star sat down with TshisaLIVE recently and revealed that she made a decision several years ago to be more transparent about her life and challenges. Our people know more about international artists than about us. Ask anyone what Beyonc s favourite colour is and they can tell you. But ask them the same thing about local stars and they can t answer you. People need to know about us. We need to talk more about ourselves Mshoza said.But how does she deal with the constant scrutiny and intrusion into her private life?She said that she learnt to not to let the negative headlines get to her and to embrace whatever is said about her.Mshoza admitted that she had tried to step out of the spotlight before but found it difficult to watch people discuss her life while she was on the sidelines. I tried to move away from the industry and try to become more private about my life but I found that the media just made up more stories about me. So I thought: If they are going to talk about me I would rather they talk while I am around and can tell people the truth . I really don t mind the spotlight she said.
