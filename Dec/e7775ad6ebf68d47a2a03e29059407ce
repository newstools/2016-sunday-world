"Please, this is not a laughing matter"This because Absa bank has obtained a court order to kick him out of his R1-million house in Corlett Gardens, north Joburg, after he failed to keep up with monthly instalments.Mvelase, who plays Phumelele's uncle in Isibaya, confirmed the bank wanted to evict him from his crib but said he was talking to his lawyers to help him save it from going under the hammer."My brother, I'm talking to the lawyers about this matter, but you are being unfair, you can't be talking to me about this matter."Please my brother, this is not a laughing matter," he said before hanging up.According to court documents we have seen, he bought the joint for R756000 in 2014 and later obtained a R151200 loan against the property.He has been paying R8590 in monthly instalments but defaulted late last year.He is over R100000 in arrears after ignoring the bank's repeated pleas to keep the account up to date.The documents also revealed that repeated attempts by the Sheriff of the Court to serve summons on him hit a brick wall as he allegedly always locked himself in the house .The bank was granted the order to auction the pad in his absence at the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on November 23.
