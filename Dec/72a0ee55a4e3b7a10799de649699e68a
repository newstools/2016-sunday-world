Shangaan disco king Penny Penny was a little apprehensive this week as his day of reckoning approached.He will know this coming Saturday whether his fans love or hate his new sound.His first concert is at The Bassline in Newtown, Joburg, where he will introduce music from his new house album.The 14-track album, Siyavuma, is a complete departure from his traditional Xitsonga sound that his fans have known for 20 years."I am waiting to see whether the public would prefer me keeping up with the latest trends or not. Personally, I love my new album," he says.Penny Penny enlisted the services of DJ Maphorisa, who has become hot property after producing Canadian rapper Drake's hit song One Dance.He says the concert will feature both his golden oldies and new tracks. "I will be doing a mix."The singer, who burst into the music scene with the mega-hit Shaka Bundu two decades ago, says music is his life. "My spirit is at ease when I am on stage."However, he is not planning to leave politics because he loves helping people. He has been an ANC ward councillor in Giyani, Limpopo, since 2011.He says his fondest memory was "getting comfort" from his mother's breast. "I was breast- fed until I was three years old," he says. His mom remains the most important person in his life and role model.The show starts at 8pm on Saturday.
