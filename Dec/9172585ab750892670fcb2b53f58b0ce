"They are going to pay for my ideas because they have used them without my permission"Motsoaledi and Polokwane City boss Johnny Mogaladi are being accused by Limpopo-based herbalist Jonas Moloto of stealing intellectual property.Moloto opened the case at the Mahwelereng police station last week.He claims Motsoaledi and Mogaladi stole his cancer vaccine development idea and used it to enrich themselves.The case has since been transferred to the Hawks for investigation.Hawks spokesperson Hangwani Mulaudzi confirmed they were investigating Moloto's case."We are investigating the allegations and, if we find anything, we will communicate it to the public," he said."But we cannot reveal the identities of the suspects at this stage," Mulaudzi cautioned.Ministerial spokesman Joe Maila said although Motsoaledi has not been formally informed of the charges against him, he was looking forward to clearing his name in a court of law."Where did he give him those ideas? The minister doesn't even conduct research."But Moloto has a constitutional right to press charges against anyone who might have wronged him," he said.Mogaladi ignored our phone calls and text messages sent to him.Moloto said: "The Hawks told me not to comment on this matter."In a statement seen by Sunday World, Moloto said he met Mogaladi at his house in Ga-Mamogoashe-Ntamaties on April 30 where he told him of his plan to travel to the US to sell his cancer vaccine development idea to medical researchers.He said Mogaladi phoned Motsoaledi and informed him of his idea and plan.Moloto claims that after the conversation Mogaladi told him the minister asked him not to take the ideas to the US but send them to him.He said he gave Mogaladi copies of his documents to pass to Motsoaledi.Mogaladi disappeared afterwards and ignored his text messages and phone calls when he asked him about the progress they made, he claims.He said he was shocked when Motsoaledi announced that the government had found a vaccine for cancer."They are going to pay for my ideas because they have already used them without my permission," he stated.
