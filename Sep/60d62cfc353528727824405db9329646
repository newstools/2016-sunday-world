 But the multi-talented Lorna Maseko is ticking all the boxes on her to-do list in her lifetime.From ballerina to chef, businesswoman and TV presenter.The 33-year-old Maseko, born and bred in Alexandra, northern Jozi, says she believes in living her dreams.Starting out as a ballerina at the tender age of nine, Maseko says she was already fulfilling her dream before her teenage years.Even though dancing was her passion, she says she wanted more."I wanted to do so much with my life. I wanted to be a businesswoman, a top cook and an inspiration to South Africans," she says.Maseko says growing up in the township, she did not have much, but her parents were supportive of the choices she made."I come from humble beginnings. My parents were very supportive and that encouraged me to follow through."Maseko was credited as the first professional ballet dancer of colour in the country.She says even though she loved dancing, she has always been entrepreneurial."I think I get the business side of me from my dad. I always wanted to be in some kind of business and through Faboulous Productions and other ventures I'm now living it," says Maseko.After making her mark as a black ballerina, Maseko left ballet to pursue a television career in 2007, when she joined the public broadcaster as a presenter.She made her TV debut as a presenter and producer on a show called Afro Showbiz News for SABC Africa.She quickly learnt the ropes and became comfortable on screen.This is where she decided to enter the first ever Top Billing Presenter Search where she made it to the Top 10, and earned a spot among the crew.Maseko also co-hosted and produced magazine show, the Weekender, also on SABC.She says while doing her TV shows, she developed a craving for food - not only to eat, but to create and make it her business.The nagging appetite saw Maseko enrolling in Food Preparation at the prestigious HTA School of Culinary Art in Randburg, north of Joburg.She says her experience at the school made her realise that she was right about pursuing that path."Although the transition was not clear, I have always had it in me to make my dreams valid."From being a ballerina, to food and now business, I knew it was going to work," says Maseko.She says her passion for food came from her love for hosting dinner parties for friends."I love hosting dinners and cooking with friends, being in the kitchen just fascinates me."I don't even cook using a book, I become creative when I'm in the kitchen."She was also part of the Celebrity Masterchef South Africa where she was a finalist."After completing the Masterchef South Africa competition, I became more hungry to pursue my goals," says the gorgeous Maseko.She started getting involved in more professional cookery events and shows.Maseko hosted shows such as Cooking with Lornaand Friends in Joburg and Cape Town.Throughout 2015, she improved her talent in the cooking space.From among some of the cooking events she has hosted, Maseko chose to be part of those celebrating Heritage Month in style.Last Sunday she invited guests to Freedom Park, in Pretoria, to experience some South African traditional flavours and Mexican dishes.Maseko hosted the Mexican Fiesta with one of the top chefs in the world Orli Del Angel, who is from Mexico.The world class sous chef is from one of the world's top 50 restaurants, Quintonil, based in Mexico.Maseko says the event was a celebration of Heritage Month where people of all age groups were experimenting with various South African food flavours."It was basically a fun cooking day. Children had their own fun building burgers while parents were seeing what else they could create in their kitchen," says Maseko.The event had different packages that allowed guests to choose which cooking experience they wanted to experience."We wanted to showcase the diversity of South African food while inspiring people to learn to make their own magic in the kitchen," says Maseko.Maseko is also in partnership with Gauteng Tourism Authority to contribute to the celebration of Heritage Month.
